# 📌 Skill Basic Principles

## Dialogue Approach

This skill collects information incrementally through dialogue with users.

**Initial Response**:
- Briefly ask about the challenge the user wants to address
- Confirm preferred firm format
- Don't request too much information at once
- Avoid excessive detailed questioning

**When to Start Working**:
- When the challenge overview is understood
- When the firm format is confirmed
- Or when the user indicates readiness to begin

**When Information is Insufficient**:
- Confirm only the 1-2 most important points additionally
- Gather details incrementally as work progresses

   - Check slide relationship in workflow file
   - Confirm progress status (change ⬜→📝)
   - **Display progress table to user**
     * Completed: List of slides with ✅ mark
     * In Progress: 📝 mark (current slide)
     * Uncreated: List of slides with ⬜ mark
     * Progress Rate: "X/XX slides completed (Y%)"
   - If "Independent": Proceed as is
   - If related: Check if requirements are met
     * Completion status of reference slides (check ✅ mark)
     * Material provision status
     * If insufficient, explain situation to user and present response policy
     * Continue work after obtaining consent

Step 1: Read design specifications for the slide from workflow file

Step 2: Execute web search based on specified information sources (about 3-8 searches, adjusted by format)

Step 3: Organize and analyze collected data

Step 4a: **Present Slide Image Diagram**
   - Illustrate visual composition of slide

   [Display complete text of finished slide]
   
   "Please let me know specifically if any parts need modification."
   "If there are no issues, please say 'OK', 'Next', etc."
   
   - Wait until user gives OK
   - Adjust relevant parts if modification requests exist
   - Request confirmation again after modification

Step 9: Update Progress Status
   - Change slide status from 📝→✅
   - Update progress summary in workflow file
   - Recalculate progress rate

Step 10: Update and save Markdown file

Step 11: Report completion to user and display progress
   "Slide #○ completed (✅). MD file updated."
   
   **Updated Progress Table:**
   ```
   ✅ Slide 1: Cover
   ✅ Slide 2: Overall Summary
   ✅ Slide 3: Market Environment Analysis (←Completed)
   ⬜ Slide 4: Competitive Analysis

## 💡 Best Practices (Expanded)

### Data Collection (Enhanced)
- **Actively use web search**: 8-15 items in Phase 1, 3-8 items per slide
- **Prioritize reliable sources**: Government statistics > Industry associations > Research firms > Corporate reports
- **Cross-check with multiple sources**: Don't rely on single source (minimum 2-3 sources)
- **Always cite data sources**: "Source: Ministry of Economy XX Statistics 2025, URL"
- **Specify assumptions for estimates**: Show calculation process for Fermi estimates
- **Confirm recency**: Check publication date of data, supplement old data
- **Utilize industry benchmarks**: Comparison with standard metrics

### Analytical Approach (Enhanced)
- **Thorough hypothesis thinking**: Focus on data needed for hypothesis verification, not all data
- **Think from zero base**: Don't be bound by preconceptions
- **Be conscious of MECE**: Check for omissions and overlaps in breakdown
- **Pursue So What**: Derive insights, not just data
- **Thorough quantification**: Express numerically whenever possible
- **Consider multiple scenarios**: Examine base, optimistic, and pessimistic cases
- **Both risks and opportunities**: Balanced analysis

### Document Creation (Enhanced)
- **1 slide = 1 message**: Clarify what you want to convey
- **1 slide = 1 chart principle**: Don't split into multiple small charts (3-4 charts), **consolidate into one integrated chart**
  - When showing multiple data, use compound graphs, stacked graphs, matrix diagrams, etc.
  - Example: "Market size" + "Growth rate" + "Share" → Consolidate into one compound graph
  - Example: "Competitor A" + "Competitor B" + "Competitor C" → Consolidate into one comparison table or positioning map
  - Don't separate each data into individual charts
- **Conclusion first**: State conclusion first (top-down communication)
- **Data-driven**: Always provide evidence for assertions
- **Actionable**: Provide feasible recommendations with specific steps
- **Format consistency**: Apply selected format style throughout
- **Visual-focused**: Make intuitively understandable with charts
- **Story quality**: Balance between logical flow and emotional appeal

### Progress Management
- **Regular progress updates**: Update after each slide completion
- **Ensure transparency**: User can always track progress
- **Easy interruption/resumption**: Design that allows pausing and resuming anytime

## 📞 Support and Troubleshooting

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I change the format midway?**
A: Not recommended for consistency, but regenerating the entire document with a new format is possible.

**Q: Can I mix multiple formats?**
A: While we recommend unifying with one format,
   applying a different style to specific slides only is also possible.

**Q: What if progress status doesn't update correctly?**
A: Manually check/correct the configuration file and re-upload it.

**Q: Can I pause work and resume days later?**
A: Yes. If you upload the configuration file (with progress) and presentation file,
   you can resume from the exact position.

**Q: Can I create a custom format?**
